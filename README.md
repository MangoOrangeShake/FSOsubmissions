I found https://fullstackopen.com/ just browsing on reddit for resources that I could use on learning application security. I sort of realized I do have to start over with web development if I wanted even a slight chance in understanding web and application security. My plans sort of go like this: 

Junior Web Dev -> Fullstack Web Dev -> DevOps -> Pentester / Web Application Security

Here's to beginning my path and following through!

### Part 0 - Fundamentals of Web Apps

### Part 1 - Introduction to React

### Part 2 - Communicating with the Server

### Part 3 - Programming a Server with NodeJS and Express

### Part 4 - Testing Express Servers, user administration

### Part 5 - Testing React Apps

### Part 6 - State Management with Redux

### Part 7 - React router, custom hooks, styling app with CSS and webpack
